# WifiQR [![](https://github.com/jamsinclair/wifiqr/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jamsinclair/wifiqr/actions)

> A simple and minimal experience for creating Wi-Fi QR Codes in your browser that you can trust.

Just enough JavaScript to get the job done yet remaining readable and approachable, even when compiled (Currently 46 lines source, 62 lines compiled).

Only **one** external dependency which is the QR Code library, [node-qrcode](https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode). 

All web assets hosted with GitHub pages and directly inspectable both in browser and this repo. No cross domain resources used.
